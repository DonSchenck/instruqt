  The etcd operator manages etcd clusters deployed to Kubernetes and automates tasks related to operating an etcd cluster.

  - [Backup and Restore](https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator#backup-and-restore-an-etcd-cluster)

  There are [more spec examples](https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator/blob/master/doc/user/spec_examples.md) on setting up clusters with different configurations

  Read [Best Practices](https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator/blob/master/doc/best_practices.md) for more information on how to better use etcd operator.

  Read [RBAC docs](https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator/blob/master/doc/user/rbac.md) for how to setup RBAC rules for etcd operator if RBAC is in place.

  Read [Developer Guide](https://github.com/coreos/etcd-operator/blob/master/doc/dev/developer_guide.md) for setting up a development environment if you want to contribute.

    Let's begin by creating a new project called `myproject`:

    ```
    oc new-project myproject
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Create the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for the Etcd Operator:

    ```

    Create a dedicated Service Account responsible for running the Etcd Operator:

    ```
    cat > etcd-operator-sa.yaml<<EOF

  title: Creating the EtcdCluster Custom Resource (CR)
  assignment: |
    Ensure you are currently scoped to the `myproject` Namespace:

    ```
    oc project myproject
    ```
    `
    ```

    Create an Etcd cluster by referring to the new Custom Resource, `EtcdCluster`, defined in the Custom Resource Definition on Step 1:

    ```
    cat > etcd-operator-cr.yaml<<EOF
    apiVersion: etcd.database.coreos.com/v1beta2
    kind: EtcdCluster

    ```
    oc create -f etcd-operator-cr.yaml

    Verify the cluster object was created:

    ```
    oc get etcdclusters
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Watch the pods in the Etcd cluster get created:

    ```
    oc get pods -l etcd_cluster=example-etcd-cluster -w
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Verify the cluster has been exposed via a ClusterIP service:

  title: Interacting with a Live Etcd Cluster
  assignment: |
    Let's now create another pod and attempt to connect to the etcd cluster via `etcdctl`:

    ```
    oc run etcdclient --image=busybox busybox --restart=Never -- /usr/bin/tail -f /dev/null
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Access the pod:

    ```
    oc rsh etcdclient
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>

    Install the Etcd Client:

    ```
    wget https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v3.1.4/etcd-v3.1.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    tar -xvf etcd-v3.1.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    cp etcd-v3.1.4-linux-amd64/etcdctl .
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Set the etcd version and endpoint variables:

    ```
    export ETCDCTL_API=3
    export ETCDCTL_ENDPOINTS=example-etcd-cluster-client:2379
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Attempt to write a key/value into the Etcd cluster:

    ```
    ./etcdctl put operator sdk
    ./etcdctl get operator
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>

  title: Scaling and Modifying the Etcd Version
  assignment: |
    Let's change the size of the Etcd `example-etcd-cluster` CR. The Etcd Operator pod will detect the CR `spec.size` change and modify the number of pods in the cluster:

    ```
    oc patch etcdcluster example-etcd-cluster --type='json' -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/size", "value":5}]'
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>

    Let's change the version of our `example-etcd-cluster` CR. The etcd-operator pod will detect the CR `spec.version` change and create a new cluster with the newly specified image:

    ```
    oc patch etcdcluster example-etcd-cluster --type='json' -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/version", "value":3.2.13}]'
