  # What is Node.js

  Node.js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine for building fast and scaleable server-side applications.  It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture, which makes it an efficient and suitable choice for applications running in a Kubernetes environment.

  ## Goal

  This track provides an introduction to cloud-native development with Node.js by walking you through how to extend an Express.js-based application to leverage cloud capabilities.

  Target Audience: This track is aimed at developers who are familiar with Node.js but want to gain a base understanding of some of the key concepts of cloud-native development with Node.js.

  ## Concepts and techniques you'll cover

  * Create an Express.js application
  * Add logging
  * Add health checks
  * Deploy your application to Openshift


  The content of this track is based on recommendations from the [NodeShift Reference Architecture for Node.js.](https://github.com/nodeshift/nodejs-reference-architecture)
