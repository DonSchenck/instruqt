  ## Goal

  Explore OpenShift version 4.12.

  ## Concepts

  * OpenShift Web Console
  * `oc` command line tool

  ## Use case

  You control an OpenShift cluster for one hour. You can test and deploy your own container image, or set up a pipeline to build your application from source, then monitor it with Prometheus as it runs.

  This OpenShift cluster will self-destruct in one hour.
